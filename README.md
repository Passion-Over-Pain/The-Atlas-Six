## Project Vision

>[!Caution]
>The Atlas Six is a desktop only game. Currently the project is not open-source. I have left the contribution procedure as I plan to make it open-source after public release.

The **Atlas Six** is a story-driven RPG set in a world of magic, ancient mysteries, and alliances that are not always what they seem. The journey revolves around the choices made by the player and the evolving relationships within the party. At the heart of the game, you'll find the **Atlas Six**â€”a group of heroes bound by a common fate, though each of them carries their own burdens.

In a world where secrets lie behind decisions made, one thing is certain: not all allies are as trustworthy as they seem, and the line between friend and foe is often blurred. Will you forge an alliance, uncover the truth, or destroy everything in your path?

## Game Features

- **Branching Storylines**: Your choices will shape the narrative, leading to different outcomes.
- **Dynamic Character Interactions**: Develop relationships with members of the **Atlas Six** and influence the course of the game.
- **Combat System**: Engage in fast-paced battles with mechanics like quick attack decisions and combos.
- **Mini-Games**: Combat is not always won on the battlefield. Your mind often finds itself at war with tests, riddles and mini games, changing the course of your story.
- **Interactive NPCs**: Converse with NPCs to uncover the truth but beware: the truth is not always pretty.

## Notes and Tips

- The game utilizes complex branching paths, so any changes to the storyline JSON structure should be tested thoroughly.
- Ensure all animations and interactive UI elements are optimized for low-end PCs (4GB RAM, i3 processors).
- Keep an eye on performance when implementing complex combat mechanics and memory mini-games.
- The current file size is approximately **900MB** due to assets like images and sounds; consider using compression tools if needed.
