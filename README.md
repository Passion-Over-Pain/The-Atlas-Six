## Project Vision

>[!Caution]
>The Atlas Six is a desktop only game. Currently the project is not open-source. I have left the contribution procedure as I plan to make it open-source after public release.

The **Atlas Six** is a story-driven RPG set in a world of magic, ancient mysteries, and alliances that are not always what they seem. The journey revolves around the choices made by the player and the evolving relationships within the party. At the heart of the game, you'll find the **Atlas Six**â€”a group of heroes bound by a common fate, though each of them carries their own burdens.

In a world where secrets lie behind decisions made, one thing is certain: not all allies are as trustworthy as they seem, and the line between friend and foe is often blurred. Will you forge an alliance, uncover the truth, or destroy everything in your path?
